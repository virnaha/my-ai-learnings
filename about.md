# About This Workshop

This workshop material was created for Zenloop's 2025 AI enablement series. It documents the real-world journey of building an AI-powered RFP analyzer from scratch—including all the successes, failures, and lessons learned along the way.

## What You'll Learn

- How to build practical AI tools without being an AI expert
- The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach to knowledge management
- Meta-prompting techniques for better AI collaboration
- Platform selection for different project phases
- Real-world adoption challenges and solutions

## Who This Is For

- Solution engineers looking to leverage AI in their workflow
- Product managers interested in AI-powered automation
- Anyone with a repetitive knowledge retrieval problem
- Teams drowning in RFPs, QBRs, or similar document-heavy work

## The Philosophy

**Ship 80%, not 100%.** This isn't about building perfect systems—it's about solving real problems fast with tools that work for you.
